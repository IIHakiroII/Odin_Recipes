  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>The creole pavilion is a traditional dish of Venezuelan gastronomy, in addition to being considered the "national dish of Venezuela." It is called this way because of its resemblance to a pavilion or flag, since it combines different colors. The traditional Creole pavilion is made up of cooked white rice, shredded beef, black beans and slices of fried ripe plantain.</p>
  <p>The history of the pavilion dates back to the imperial era, probably from the 18th century, and according to what is said, it is basically a gathering of "leftovers" from previous meals made by the slaves of the haciendas: thus the meat, rice and black beans generally dated back to from a previous day or two, with the banana slices being the only thing that was prepared at the time.</p>

  <h3>Steps to make a creole pavilion:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Before making the Creole pavilion, the first step is to get all the ingredients ready.</li>
    <li>In a pressure cooker, seal the brisket previously seasoned with salt, pepper and cumin. When it is golden, remove and add the onion, pepper, skinless tomato and garlic, all finally chopped, and cook very well until soft.</li>
    <li>Return the meat to the pot, add the Worcestershire sauce, water or beef broth until it covers the meat a little. Also add the cilantro branch, a little more cumin, salt and pepper. Cover the pressure cooker and cook for 1 and a half hours.</li>
    <li>When the meat is ready, shred it with your hands or a fork and return it to the pot so that it absorbs more of the flavor of the rest of the ingredients. Reserve until serving time.</li>
    <li>For the beans, let them soak the night before, when preparing them add plenty of water to a pressure cooker, add the beans with a little onion and salt, and let cook for 1 hour and a half.</li>
    <li>In a frying pan, prepare a sauce with the onion, red pepper, finely chopped garlic and grated parsley. Then, add it to the beans (if they have a lot of water you can remove a little), cook over medium heat until they thicken a little, adjust the flavor with salt, cumin and pepper.</li>
    <li>In a separate pan with oil at medium heat, fry the banana slices until golden.</li>
    <li>Finally, serve the Venezuelan Creole pavilion with black beans, shredded meat, white rice and banana slices. If you liked this recipe, have any comments or concerns, give us your opinion.</li>
